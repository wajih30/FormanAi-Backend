This is the backend code for my final year project.
I created an academic assistance chatbot based on my university, which included all the courses for each department in the database. 
It helped in students getting their degree audited by a simple upload of your transcript, it is not an offical degree audit but for students to understand how much progress have they made related to their major.
Secondly it is a useful tool for FCCU students to get a general advice based on the grades and courses they have taken about how they are performing, course suggestion on what they can study in the next semesters to make their grades better as well as suggestions on career paths they can choose in the future based on the courses they have taken.
It all happens with a simple screenshot or pdf upload of your transcript.
